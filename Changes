Revision history and release notes for Mail::GPG.

0.97 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Mail::GPG::Result->as_string() reported some warnings
	  regarding uninitialized values. Thanks to Edward J. Sabol
	  <sabol AT alderaan.gsfc.nasa.gov> for his patch.
	- mgpg-test script now has the -w switch

0.96 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- added missing dependency GnuPG::Interface in Makefile.PL
	  Reported through cpan-testers.

0.95 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
	Features:
	- query_keyring() now returns all matching entries as a
	  list of key-id/address pairs, which can be slurped
	  into a hash. The old behaviour is still warranted, so
	  this extension is backward compatible.
	- the signer's aliases are now reported with the new
	  sign_mail_aliases attribute of Mail::GPG::Result. Thanks
	  for the suggestion to Piotr Maj <ant AT kernelpanic.pl>.

	Bugfixes:
	- some methods failed on systems with non-english
	  locales. Thanks to Daniel Ciaglia <daniel AT ciaglia.de>
	  and Piotr Maj for their reports.
	- not a fix in Mail::GPG but in MIME-tools: some mail
	  user agents (like mutt and sylpheed) add an empty line
	  as a preamble before the first part of a MIME signed
	  mail, if the message itself has attachments. MIME-tools
	  suppress this line on output, so the signature gets
	  invalid. Mail::GPG ships with a new patch to MIME-tools
	  5.411 which fixes this problem. Thanks for the report
	  to Daniel Ciaglia.

0.94 Sun Feb 15, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- new I/O multiplex code needed some adjustments to
	  work with Perl 5.005_03, because its read() and seek()
	  functions work on native filehandles only.

0.93 Sat Feb 14 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- perform multiplexed I/O with gpg to prevent buffering
	  deadlocks which may occur with huge amounts of data.
	  Added a new test t/04.big.t, which creates a 4 MB
	  entity and signs it. This test takes some time (on
	  an Athlon 1800XP about 20 seconds), so be patient ;)
	- set LC_MESSAGES=C where output of gpg is parsed to
	  get status information. Without this some Mail::GPG
	  methods didn't work on systems with non english locales.

0.92 Fri Feb 13 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- make test failed on systems without the MIME-tools
	  patch, although the corresponding tests were skipped.

0.91 Wed Feb 11 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- mime_sign_encrypt: check key_id only if entity should
	  be signed
	- ignore SIGPIPE from gpg
