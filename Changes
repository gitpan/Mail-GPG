Revision history and release notes for Mail::GPG.

1.0.0 Sat Nov 20, 2004, joern
	Features:
	- new parse() convenience method for parsing a mail message.
	  It uses MIME::Parser and distinguish between MIME and
	  non-MIME messages, doing the right thing regarding reading
	  decoded or encoded bodies.
	
	Bugfixes:
	- decrypt(): used encoded entity instead of decoded in case
	  of a MIME message. Thanks for the report to Paul Murphy
	  <pmurphy AT ionixpharma.com>.

0.98 Sun Jun 27, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Mail::GPG->decrypt() died on encrypted+signed mails for
	  which the public key was missing (and thus no verification
	  possible). That's not what we expect, instead we can check
	  the verification through the returned result object but
	  have a successfully decrypted mail.

0.97 Tue Jun 15, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Mail::GPG::Result->as_string() reported some warnings
	  regarding uninitialized values. Thanks to Edward J. Sabol
	  <sabol AT alderaan.gsfc.nasa.gov> for his patch.
	- mgpg-test script now has the -w switch

0.96 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- added missing dependency GnuPG::Interface in Makefile.PL
	  Reported through cpan-testers.

0.95 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
	Features:
	- query_keyring() now returns all matching entries as a
	  list of key-id/address pairs, which can be slurped
	  into a hash. The old behaviour is still warranted, so
	  this extension is backward compatible.
	- the signer's aliases are now reported with the new
	  sign_mail_aliases attribute of Mail::GPG::Result. Thanks
	  for the suggestion to Piotr Maj <ant AT kernelpanic.pl>.

	Bugfixes:
	- some methods failed on systems with non-english
	  locales. Thanks to Daniel Ciaglia <daniel AT ciaglia.de>
	  and Piotr Maj for their reports.
	- not a fix in Mail::GPG but in MIME-tools: some mail
	  user agents (like mutt and sylpheed) add an empty line
	  as a preamble before the first part of a MIME signed
	  mail, if the message itself has attachments. MIME-tools
	  suppress this line on output, so the signature gets
	  invalid. Mail::GPG ships with a new patch to MIME-tools
	  5.411 which fixes this problem. Thanks for the report
	  to Daniel Ciaglia.

0.94 Sun Feb 15, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- new I/O multiplex code needed some adjustments to
	  work with Perl 5.005_03, because its read() and seek()
	  functions work on native filehandles only.

0.93 Sat Feb 14 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- perform multiplexed I/O with gpg to prevent buffering
	  deadlocks which may occur with huge amounts of data.
	  Added a new test t/04.big.t, which creates a 4 MB
	  entity and signs it. This test takes some time (on
	  an Athlon 1800XP about 20 seconds), so be patient ;)
	- set LC_MESSAGES=C where output of gpg is parsed to
	  get status information. Without this some Mail::GPG
	  methods didn't work on systems with non english locales.

0.92 Fri Feb 13 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- make test failed on systems without the MIME-tools
	  patch, although the corresponding tests were skipped.

0.91 Wed Feb 11 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- mime_sign_encrypt: check key_id only if entity should
	  be signed
	- ignore SIGPIPE from gpg
