Revision history and release notes for Mail::GPG.

1.0.3 Fri Dec 22, 2005, joern
    Notes:
    - No code changes, just removed MIME-tools patches from the
      distribution because the official MIME-tools 5.419 package
      now contains them.
    - That's why Mail::GPG instists on MIME-tools 5.419 from now on.
    - Removed all pointers to the MIME-tools patch from the
      documentation.

1.0.2 Sat Dec 17, 2005, joern
    Features:
    - Added a patch against MIME-tools 5.418, which hopefully
      gets into the official distribution soon. Thanks to
      Edward J. Sabol <sabol AT alderaan.gsfc.nasa.gov> who
      helped me to get this patch right.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a (potential) bug with Mail::GPG->get_key_trust(),
      which was reported and debugged by Edward J. Sabol, but
      couldn't be reproduced on my system. However the fix
      is harmless, so I added it.

1.0.1 Sun Dec 5, 2004, joern
    Features:
    - New methods requested by Kjetil Kjernsmo <kjetil AT kjernsmo.net>
      - Mail::GPG->is_signed_quick()
      - Mail::GPG->get_key_trust()
      - Mail::GPG::Result->get_sign_trust()
      - Mail::GPG::Result->get_enc_trust()
    - A patch for GnuPG::Interface 0.33 fixing a (harmless but
      annoying ;) warning about unknown record types on keyring
      inspection with newer GnuPG versions.

1.0.0 Sat Nov 20, 2004, joern
    Features:
    - New parse() convenience method for parsing a mail message.
      It uses MIME::Parser and distinguish between MIME and
      non-MIME messages, doing the right thing regarding reading
      decoded or encoded bodies.

    Bugfixes:
    - decrypt(): used encoded entity instead of decoded in case
      of a MIME message. Thanks for the report to Paul Murphy
      <pmurphy AT ionixpharma.com>.

0.98 Sun Jun 27, 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Mail::GPG->decrypt() died on encrypted+signed mails for
      which the public key was missing (and thus no verification
      possible). That's not what we expect, instead we can check
      the verification through the returned result object but
      have a successfully decrypted mail.

0.97 Tue Jun 15, 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Mail::GPG::Result->as_string() reported some warnings
      regarding uninitialized values. Thanks to Edward J. Sabol
      <sabol AT alderaan.gsfc.nasa.gov> for his patch.
    - mgpg-test script now has the -w switch

0.96 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Added missing dependency GnuPG::Interface in Makefile.PL
      Reported through cpan-testers.

0.95 Sat May 29, 2004, joern
    Features:
    - query_keyring() now returns all matching entries as a
      list of key-id/address pairs, which can be slurped
      into a hash. The old behaviour is still warranted, so
      this extension is backward compatible.
    - The signer's aliases are now reported with the new
      sign_mail_aliases attribute of Mail::GPG::Result. Thanks
      for the suggestion to Piotr Maj <ant AT kernelpanic.pl>.

    Bugfixes:
    - Some methods failed on systems with non-english
      locales. Thanks to Daniel Ciaglia <daniel AT ciaglia.de>
      and Piotr Maj for their reports.
    - Not a fix in Mail::GPG but in MIME-tools: some mail
      user agents (like mutt and sylpheed) add an empty line
      as a preamble before the first part of a MIME signed
      mail, if the message itself has attachments. MIME-tools
      suppress this line on output, so the signature gets
      invalid. Mail::GPG ships with a new patch to MIME-tools
      5.411 which fixes this problem. Thanks for the report
      to Daniel Ciaglia.

0.94 Sun Feb 15, 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - New I/O multiplex code needed some adjustments to
      work with Perl 5.005_03, because its read() and seek()
      functions work on native filehandles only.

0.93 Sat Feb 14 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Perform multiplexed I/O with gpg to prevent buffering
      deadlocks which may occur with huge amounts of data.
      Added a new test t/04.big.t, which creates a 4 MB
      entity and signs it. This test takes some time (on
      an Athlon 1800XP about 20 seconds), so be patient ;)
    - Set LC_MESSAGES=C where output of gpg is parsed to
      get status information. Without this some Mail::GPG
      methods didn't work on systems with non english locales.

0.92 Fri Feb 13 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - make test failed on systems without the MIME-tools
      patch, although the corresponding tests were skipped.

0.91 Wed Feb 11 2004, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - mime_sign_encrypt: check key_id only if entity should
      be signed
    - Ignore SIGPIPE from gpg
